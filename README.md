Puzilla
=======

Physics! Chain falling blocks for high combos!

Blocks fall from the top and same colored ones get linked together when next to each other.
You can run & jump through the block maze and create blasts which throw nearby blocks in the air and away.
Try to link as many blocks as possible and then clear them for high combo scores!
